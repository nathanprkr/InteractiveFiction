In Chapter 1 - The Hospital Room:


  >--> You wrote 'If the player greets the Nurse' (source text, line 50): but
    the punctuation here ':' makes me think this should be a definition of a
    phrase and it doesn't begin as it should, with either 'To' (e.g. 'To flood
    the riverplain:'), 'Definition:', a name for a rule (e.g. 'This is the
    devilishly cunning rule:'), 'At' plus a time (e.g. 'At 11:12 PM:' or 'At
    the time when the clock chimes') or the name of a rulebook, possibly
    followed by some description of the action or value to apply to (e.g.
    'Instead of taking something:' or 'Every turn:').
