"The Nurse" by Nathan Parker

Chapter 1 - The Hospital Room

When play begins, say "'You wake up in a hospital bed, the faint smell of antiseptic lingering in the air. The walls are pale blue, and medical equipment hums softly nearby. You feel groggy, your body aching from the effects of painkillers.'";

The Hospital Room is a room. 

The Bed is an enterable supporter in the Hospital Room. "The hospital bed looks old but functional, with crisp white sheets that smell faintly of bleach." 

The toilet is a fixed in place container in the Hospital Room. "A plain white toilet sits in the corner of the room, functional but unremarkable."

Using is an action applying to one thing. 

Understand "use [something]" or "sit on [something]" as using.

Check using:
	if the noun is not the toilet:
		say "That's not something you can use like that." instead.

Carry out using:
	if the noun is the toilet:
		say "You use the toilet. It's a small relief amidst the strange environment.";

The table is a supporter in the Hospital Room. "A small table stands beside the bed." 

The drawer is a part of the Table.
The drawer is an openable closed container.

The description of the table is "The table has a single drawer, currently closed."

Sand Counter is a number that varies. Sand Counter is 0.

The sand is in the Drawer. The description of the sand is "A small pile of sand, dry and oddly out of place in a hospital setting." 

Instead of eating the sand:
	increment the Sand Counter;
	say "You eat the sand.";
	if the Sand Counter is 15:
		say "The nurse watches, distrubed as you shovel handful after handful of sand through your parched lips. She eventually leaves, and you continue to eat sand to your hearts content.";
		end the story finally saying "You win. Good job eating sand";
	
The Hopstial Room Door is a door. The Hopstial Room Door is east of the Hospital Room and west of The Hallway. The Hopstial Room Door is open. The description of the Hopstial Room Door is "The door is wide open, leading to what appears to be a brightly lit hallway." 

The Nurse is a person in the Hospital Room. "The Nurse stands nearby, her expression a mixture of professionalism and concern." The Nurse has a number called knowledge. The knowledge of the Nurse is 0.

The Nurse can be greeted or ungreeted. The Nurse is ungreeted.

Asked about family is a truth state that varies. Asked about crash is a truth state that varies. Asked about pain is a truth state that varies. Asked about deaths is a truth state that varies. Asked about recovery is a truth state that varies.

Interrogative is a kind of value. The interrogatives are who, what, when, where, how, about, and why.

Current question is an interrogative that varies.

Understand "ask [someone] [text]" as asking it about.

Every turn when the player is in the Hospital Room:
	increment the knowledge of the Nurse;
	if the knowledge of the Nurse is 25:
		say "The Nurse looks at you one last time as you pass out from the pain. You eventually recover and face trial for the deaths you caused while drunk driving.";
		now the player is in The Courtroom;
		stop the action;

After reading a command:
	if the player's command includes "[interrogative]", now the current question is the interrogative understood.
	
After asking someone about something: respond to the question. After answering someone that something: respond to the question.

Greeting is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "greet [thing]" or "say hello to [thing]" or "say hi to [thing]" or "wave to [thing]" or "hello [thing]" as greeting.

Carry out greeting:
	if the noun is the Nurse:
		if the Nurse is ungreeted:
			now the Nurse is greeted;
			say "'Hello, how are you feeling?' says the Nurse gently. 'You were in a car accident. Take it easy and let me know if you have questions.'";
		otherwise:
			say "The Nurse is waiting for your questions.";

Talking to is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "talk to [thing]" or "ask [thing]" as talking to.

	if the Nurse is ungreeted, say "You should greet the Nurse first." instead.
